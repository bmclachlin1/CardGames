# Childrens-Card-Games

This is a group project I did with two of my classmates while I was in my third semester of University.
We programmed three object-oriented card games in C++ including GoFish, CrazyEights, and Uno. 
We also added unit testing for the games using gtest.

To Play the game:

First, clone the git repository as such:

git clone https://github.com/bmclachlin1/CardGames

To compile the game, type: "make game" in the command line. in the root directory for the games, 
there should be an executable called runningGame. Run the executable by typing runningGame in the 
command line.
