UNO RULES & HOW TO PLAY

The point of Uno is to get rid of all of your cards before everyone else does. The discard pile will first start with 
a random card. Card's consist of a rank and a face (or special value, explained later). On your turn, you must play 
a card that's rank or face matches the rank or face of the card on the top of the discard pile. You win the game when 
you successfully get rid of all the cards in your hand.

Some special cards are as follows:

Skip: Skip's the next players turn
Reverse: Reverses the turn order
Draw2: Forces the opponent to draw two cards from the drawpile
Draw4: Forces the opponent to draw four cards from the drawpile
SwitchColor: Allows you to switch the color of the playing field (Yellow, Blue, Green, or Red)

Have Fun!!!
